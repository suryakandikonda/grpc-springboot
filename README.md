# gRPC Spring Boot Application

This project is a gRPC-based application developed using Spring Boot and Java 21. It demonstrates how to integrate gRPC with Spring Boot for high-performance, cross-language RPC (Remote Procedure Call) communication. This project can serve as a foundation for building microservices with gRPC in Java.

## Features
- **gRPC Server**: Implements a gRPC server in Spring Boot for handling client requests.
- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**: Uses Protobuf to define service and message structure, ensuring efficient serialization.
- **High-Performance**: Leverages gRPC's HTTP/2-based communication protocol for low latency and high throughput.
- **Cross-Language**: Enables cross-language communication, allowing clients written in other languages (e.g., Python, Go) to communicate with this gRPC service.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Utilizes Spring Boot's capabilities for easier configuration and management.

## Prerequisites
- **Java 21**: Ensure Java 21 is installed.
- **Maven**: Used for dependency management and building the project.
- **Protocol Buffers Compiler (`protoc`)**: Required for generating Java classes from `.proto` files.
